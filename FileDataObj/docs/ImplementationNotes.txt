Implementation Notes:

- I wrote these programs to take data from an input file and return a usable Python data object
- There is also a file that does the reverse, i.e. takes a Python data objectand outputs it
into a file
- On original writing, this is done for lists and dictionaries. As list is not
formally specified in the code, the 'list' programs could conceivably work
for other Python data object ty[es
